Launch the Developer Portal in a browser using the link provided.\n\n2.  If you are logged in to the portal, log out to clear your session.\n\n3.  Click the [[API\n    Products]] link.  ![](images/tutorial_html_444fff2d8e0d46b7.png)\n\n4.  Notice that only the Inventory product is listed, even though you\n    just published the Accessories product. Recall that you assigned the\n    Accessories product to be visible only by developers who are logged\n    in to the portal.\n\n5.  Enter Login page using Sign in option at the top right corner of the\n    page.\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_db604e248301f829.png)\n\n6.  Login using the username \\<portaluser\\> and password\n    \\<portaluser-password\\>\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_492593c5f2350159.png)\n\n7.  Click the [[API\n    Products]] link\n    after logging in.\n\n8.  Select the [[ Accessories\n    1.0.0]] product. \n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_6efccbf2582a30c0.png)  \n\n9.  You will be directed to the Product page which lists the available\n    plans for subscription.\n    Click [[Subscribe]] under\n    the [[Silver]] plan.  ![](images/tutorial_html_fd5ece1fe8b66fa5.png)\n\n10. **Note:** The Gold plan requires approval by the API provider for\n    any subscription requests and allows unlimited requests for a given\n    time period. The Silver plan is limited to 100 requests per hour and\n    does not require approval by the API provider for subscription\n    requests.\n\n11. A subscription wizard is initiated. All the applications available\n    are displayed (in this case we only have the IBM Consumer\n    application). Click [[Select\n    App]] which\n    is located below the application\n    tile.  \n    ![](images/tutorial_html_fe0fc338b5ae9fd3.png)\n\n12. A window with the subscription details is displayed to confirm the\n    information provided.\n    Click [[Next]] once\n    you have reviewed the\n    information.  \n    ![](images/tutorial_html_ea31c68f8a08a741.png)\n\n13.

This is useful for application developers to try the\nAPIs before their application is fully developed or to simply see the\nexpected response based on inputs they provide the API.\n\n1.  Click the [[logistics\n    2.0.0]] API\n    link on the Accessories product\n    page.  \n    ![](images/tutorial_html_8ec6b1024d5a2f9a.png)\n\n2.  Click the [[GET\n    /shipping]] path\n    on the left navigation menu. \n\n3.  Click the \\`Try it\\` link to access the test\n    area.  \n    ![](images/tutorial_html_6326764a039cba2b.png)\n\n4.  Scroll down to the Parameters section, enter any **United State Zip\n    Code** (e.g., \\`90210\\`) and\n    click [[Send]] to\n    invoke the API.  \n    ![](images/tutorial_html_74d26a44eab03d67.png)\n\n5.  You should see a [[200\n    OK ]]and\n    a response body as shown\n    below.  \n    ![](images/tutorial_html_f9b90c1492df91e8.png)\n\n6.  Go ahead and try out the [[Logistics GET\n    /stores]] and\n    the [[Financing GET\n    /calculate ]]APIs\n    as well.\n\n## Summary\n\nCongratulations! You have created multiple plans, tested APIs in the\ndeveloper portal, and used the APIs in a consumer application. \n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"a978bbabbb2d9728e8da9d0f6e2caaf7","counter":1641,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"APIC Dev Jam - Lab 7 - The Consumer Experience"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: APIC Dev Jam - Lab 7 - The Consumer Experience\n---\n\nIn this lab, you will explore the consumer experience for APIs that have\nbeen exposed to your Sandbox catalog.
