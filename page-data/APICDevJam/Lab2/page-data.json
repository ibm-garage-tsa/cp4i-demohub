We will then define a new plan in the product and\npublish to our new developer portal.\n\nIn this tutorial, you will explore the following key capabilities:\n\n-   Configure the Developer Portal and publish the APIs.\n\n-   Create a Portal Account.\n\n-   Create App and Subscribe to Plan.\n\n-   Test API in the Developer Portal\n\n## APIC Dev Jam Series\n\nThe APIC Dev Jam Series is a hands-on workshop with lab exercises that\nwalk you through designing, publishing, and securing APIs.

Make sure you\nlogin using API Manager User Registry not Common Services\nregistry.]**\n\nPrerequisites: Labs 1\n\n ## Generate the developer portal\n\nA developer portal for the sandbox catalog was already configured in\nthis environment. A consumer account \"ibmuser\" was also created to use\nthe Developer Portal server. In this section, login to Developer Portal\nusing the credentials provided in email.\n\n**Login to API Connect Developer Portal**\n\n1.  API Connect Developer Portal provides consumers access to API\n    Catalog information to explore and test APIs, register Applications\n    and subscribe to Plans. Portal Administrator can customize the looks\n    and feel to their organizational specifications. The default\n    Developer Portal looks like below:\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_df45d2edf6f25ba8.png)\n\n2.  Some products are visible to all users without an account depending\n    on the Product visibility setting. Additional options are available\n    when you login to the Portal Server.\n\n    Click **Sign in** to login to the portal\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_279e27e5ac9b71cb.png)\n\n3.  Login to portal user using the username and password supplied in the\n    email.\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_d0807a5f400162a.png)\n\n4.  After successful login, you will see a Get Started page. Proceed to\n    create a new Test application.\n\n \n\n ## Register a test app\n\nAPI Connect enforces entitlement rules to ensure that consumers are\nallowed to access the APIs that are being requested. The instructions\nbelow will guide you through registering your consumer application and\nsubscribing it to an API Product.\n\n### [Create A New Consumer Application]\n\n\n1.  Click [[Create an\n    App]] in\n    the *Create a new App* tile.\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_114ebdd6ef4988c.png)\n\n2.  Give your application the title **[IBM\n    Consumer ]** and then\n    click [[Submit]].\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_c4d9babec32568f9.png)\n\n### Save the Consumer Application Credentials\n\n\nWhen your consumer application is registered in the IBM API Connect\nsystem, it is assigned a unique set of client credentials. These\ncredentials must be provided on each API request in order for the system\nto validate your subscription entitlements.\n\n1.  Click the [[Show]] box\n    in both Key and Secret to reveal it. Copy the Key and Secret. Save\n    it to a text editor. Then\n    click [[Continue. ]]You\n    can always come back to view the Key. However, if you lose the\n    Secret, you will need to generate a new one in the app settings.\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_aba0b5683b88b7d6.png)\n\n2.  Now you\\'ve entered the App Dashboard. Here you\\'re able to see the\n    analytics of your APIs.\n\n### Subscribe to the API Product\n\nAt this point, your registered consumer application has no entitlements.\nIn order to grant it access to an API resource, you must subscribe to a\nProduct and Plan.\n\n1.  Click [[API Products]] at\n    the top of the screen.\n\n2.  Click the [[inventory auto product\n    1.0.0]] product.\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_38168de09ddc40f.png)\n\n3.  Click the [[Subscribe]] button\n    for the default plan that is listed.\n\n4.  Follow the steps to **Select your application**, **Confirm\n    Subscription**, and **View Summary**. Then click **Done**.\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_cfeb4fb8846dee41.png)\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_95cbfb50e3695ef5.png)\n\n ## Test the API\n\nThe API Connect Developer Portal allows consumers to test the APIs\ndirectly from the website. This feature may be enabled or disabled\nper-API.\n\n1.  Open the **inventory 1.0.0** API to browse the API definition.\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_9830850c1b13f9c1.png)\n\n2.  Click the [[GET\n    /Items]] operation\n    on the left palette.\n\n3.  In the right column, you will find information about the request\n    parameters and links to the response schemas.\n\n4.  Click the [[Try\n    it]] tab.\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_a16511906f41b73.png)\n\n5.  If you only have one application registered, it will be\n    automatically selected in the **[Client\n    ID]** drop-down menu. If you have more\n    than one, select the application which is subscribed to this API\n    Product.\n\n6.  Paste your **[Client Secret]** into the\n    provided field.\n\n7.  Click the [[**Send**]] button\n    to invoke the API.\n\n8.  Scroll down to see the call results.\n\n**[Note: If running for the first time, you may see Code: 0 No response\nreceived. Causes include a lack of CORS support on the target server,\nthe server being unavailable, or an untrusted certificate being\nencountered. Clicking the link below will open the server in a new tab.\nIf the browser displays a certificate issue, you may choose to accept it\nand return here to test again.]**\n\n![](images/tutorial_html_1b2581520ef305f.png)\n\n## Summary\n\nYou completed the APIC Dev Jam Lab 2 - The Developer Portal Experience.\nThroughout the tutorial, you explored the key takeaways: \n\n-   Configure Developer Portal and publish the APIs.\n\n-   Create a Portal Account. \n\n-   Create App and Subscribe to Plan\n\n-   Test API in Developer Portal. \n\nContinue the APIC Dev Jam!
