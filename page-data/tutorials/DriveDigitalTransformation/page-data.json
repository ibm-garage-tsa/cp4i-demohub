You can use the Kafka Connect source connector for IBM MQ to copy data from IBM MQ into IBM Event Streams or Apache Kafka.\nPath\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Introduction</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Prepare the environment</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Configure IBM MQ</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Configure IBM Event Streams toolkit</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Setup Kafka Connect</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Setup MQ Connectors</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Configuring and running MQ Connectors</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Testing MQ Connectors</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Using Operations Dashboard (tracing)</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Summary</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe most interesting and impactful new applications in an enterprise are the applications that provide new ways of interacting with existing systems by reacting in real time to mission-critical data. Leverage your existing investments, skills and even existing data, and use event-driven techniques to offer more-responsive and more-personalized experiences. IBM Event Streams has supported connectivity to the systems you’re already using. By combining the capabilities of IBM Event Streams event streams and message queues, you can combine your transaction data with real-time events to create applications and processes. These applications and processes allow you to react to situations quickly and provide a greater personalized experience.\nIn this tutorial, you create a bidirectional connection between IBM MQ (MQ) and Event Streams by creating two message queues and two event stream topics. One is for sending and one for receiving. You then configure the message queue source and sync connectors in order to connect between the two instances.\nThe connector copies messages from a source MQ queue to a target Event Streams topic. There is also an MQ sink connector that takes messages from an Event Streams topic and transfers them to an MQ queue. Running it is similar to the source connector. In this lab, we will only cover the source and sink connectors. We will then configure the source a sink connector to run some tests to a local stand-alone worker. We then adjust our configuration to send the messages to a topic in Event Streams and run a console consumer to consume the messages.\n\n## Takeaways\n\n```\n\n- Configuring MQ to send and receive messages and events\n- Configuring Event Streams topics\n- Configuring MQ Source and Sync Connectors\n- Configuring Kafka Connect and connectors\n- Setting up and running MQ connectors source and sink\n- Using Event Streams Monitoring\n- Using tracing for MQ\n\n```\n\n## Task 1 - Prepare the environment\n\n**Note: If your using this tutorial in a multi-user ROKS setup, the environment is already prepared for you. Please login to the cluster using LDAP authentication and the credentials provided by your instructor and jump to [Configuring IBM MQ](#task-2-configuring-mq). Also, maske sure that you use a prefix provided by the instructor for queue, topic and server names.**\n\nBecause this is a new deployment of the Cloud Pak for Integration that uses Red Hat OpenShift, you need to run some steps to prepare the environment. Initial setup steps are only needed for a fresh installation of the Cloud Pak. They do not need to be repeated.\n\n**Note: For this lab, we based on MAC workstation (MAC OSX)**\n\nRequirements:\n\n```\n-\tJava Version:\n    java version \"1.8.0_261\"\n    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_261-b12)\n    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.261-b12, mixed mode)\n-\tMaven:\n    https://maven.apache.org/\n-\tGit:\n    https://git-scm.com/\n-\tOpenshift CLI installed\n    https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift-cli#cli_oc\n\n```\n\n1.In your workstation open a browser and enter http://cloud.ibm.com and enter your ibmid  and click continue and password to login IBM Cloud.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-login.png)\n\n2.Enter your IBM userid  and the password and then enter the verify code.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-sign-in.png)\n\n3.In the IBM Cloud Dashboard. You see all information about the infrastructure. On the left, click the Openshift icon.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-dashboard-openshift.png)\n\n4.Click your Cluster link.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-openshift-clusters.png)\n\n5.Click Openshift web console.\n\n![](images/ibm-clould-openshift-console.png)\n\n6.In the OpenShift console. Select the following:\n\n```\n1.\t**Networking** .\n2.\t**Routes** .\n3.\tDrill down the Project to **cp4i** .\n4.\tClick link to access Cloud Pak for Integration .\n```\n![](images/ibm-cloud-acces-cp4i-1.png)\n\n7.Click **Default authentication** as authentication type.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-cp4i-default.png)\n\n8.You might need to login screen for IBM Cloud Pak might be displayed, enter the username: **admin** and Password (**Enter the 32 characters password that you created when you made the Cloud Pak provisioning**) and Click Log in.\nTip: You might need to use the password. You can use the Clipboard to save the password.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-cp4i-login.png)\n\n9.In the **Cloud Pak Welcome** page, you see **Capabilities** and **Runtimes** instances.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-welcome-capabilities.png)\n\n## Task 2 - Configuring MQ\n\nIn this task, you work with the MQ Console, create two queues (MQTOEVENT and EVENTTOMQ), and change MQ Authorization. The IBM MQ Operator for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides an easy way to manage the lifecycle of IBM MQ queue managers.\nYou need some configuration files from Github.\n\nConnectors are available for copying data in both directions:\n\n```\n•\tKafka Connect **source** connector for IBM MQ:\n  You can use the MQ source connector to copy data from IBM MQ into IBM Event Streams or Apache Kafka. The connector copies messages from a source MQ queue to a target Kafka topic.\n•\tKafka Connect **sink** connector for IBM MQ:\n  You can use the MQ sink connector to copy data from IBM Event Streams or Apache Kafka into IBM MQ. The connector copies messages from a Kafka topic into an MQ queue.\n```\n1.Open a browser and enter: https://github.com/ibm-cloudintegration/dte-labs/tree/master/Lab4-DriveDigitalTransformation/resources  and select es-mq.zip file.\n\n![](images/lab4-github-es-mq.png)\n\n2.Click **Download**.\n\n![](images/lab4-download-git.png)\n\n3.Open a terminal window and enter **unzip es-mq.zip**. Unzip creates a directory **es-mq** in **~/Downloads** directory.\n(**Note**: Use this directory as your work directory and delete after you finish the lab).\n\n![](images/lab4-unzip-es-mq.png)\n\n4.You need to login to the Openshift Cluster. Go to Openshift Console and locate **IAM(your ibm userid)** and click **Copy Login Command**.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-login-command.png)\n\n5.Click **Display Token**.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-display-token.png)\n\n6.Copy the line **oc login  --token= ….** (all line).\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-copy-oc.png)\n\n7.In terminal window, go to **~/Downloads/es-mq** directory and Paste the oc login command.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-oc-login.png)\n\n8.In **es-mq** directory, run loadmq shell script (**./loadmq.sh**) and you see mq configuration being loaded. This shell script loads server channels and changes some securities configurations.\n\n![](images/lab4-loading-mq-conf.png)\n\n9.Prepare IBM MQ to exchange data from IBM Event Streams. You run a script file that configures MQ server (Security and Server Channel). The script creates two server channels: **EVENTTOMQ** and **MQTOEVENT**. In your browser, go to the IBM Cloud Pak Platform. You might need to log in to IBM Cloud Pak. The username and password are already cached (admin/(Enter the 32 characters password that you created when you made the Cloud Pak provisioning)). Click **Log in**.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-login-cp4i.png)\n\n10.In the **Welcome page of the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration**, click **Runtimes** and locate the **Queue Manager** in Instance Type and click **mq-demo**.\n\n![](images/lab4-cp4i-welcomepage.png)\n\n11.Firefox might warn you about a potential security risk. Click Advanced then accept the risk and Continue.\n12.In Welcome to IBM MQ page, you can run and access MQ information. Click **Create a queue**.\n\n![](images/lab4-create-queue.png)\n\n13.In Create a queue page, choose queue type: Click **Local**.\n\n![](images/lab4-create-local-queue.png)\n\n14.In the **Create a queue** page. Enter in the Queue name: **MQSOURCE**. Click **Create**.\n\n![](images/lab4-create-mqsource.png)\n\n15.And again, click Create a queue in Welcome to IBM MQ page.\n\n![](images/lab4-create-queue.png)\n\n16.On the Choose queue type, click Local.\n\n![](images/lab4-create-local-queue.png)\n\n17.Enter the queue name: **MQSINK** and click **Create**.\n\n![](images/lab4-create-mqsink.png)\n\n18.Click **Manage** on the menu to check MQ configurations.\n\n![](images/lab4-manage-queue-manager.png)\n\n19.Verify the queues that you created and queue manager name: **QUICKSTART**. Click **Communications** to verify the channels.\n\n![](images/lab4-queue-manager-communication.png)\n\n20.Verify the server channels are created. Click **App channels**. See the server channels that the **loadmq script** created: **EVENTTOMQ** to connect Event Streams to MQ and **MQTOEVENT** to connect MQ to Event Streams.\n\n![](images/lab4-check-server-channels.png)\n\n21.To connect to MQ (**QUICKSTART**), you need MQ server Address. In the Terminal. To get MQ server address, enter the OpenShift commands:\n\n```\n1. oc get svc | grep mq (list the mq services).\n2. Copy the address of mq-demo-ibm-mq (**172.21.216.195**) – This address might be different.\n```\n\n## Task 3 - Configuring Event streams\n\nNow that you are familiar with topics and creating them from the previous labs, you need to create a new topic for running the MQ source connector.\nThe connector requires details to connect to IBM MQ and to your IBM Event Streams or Apache Kafka cluster.\nThe connector connects to IBM MQ using a client connection. You must provide the following connection information for your queue manager:\n\n```\n•\tThe name of the IBM MQ queue manager: QUICKSTART\n•\tThe connection name (one or more host and port pairs): * This is the MQ host address or IP address.\n•\tThe channel name:\n•\tSink: EVENTTOMQ\n•\tSource: MQTOEVENT\n•\tThe name of the source IBM MQ queue: MQSOURCE\n•\tThe name of the sink IBM MQ queue: MQSINK\n•\tThe name of the target Kafka topic: mqtoevent\n•\tThe name of the origin Kafka topic: eventtomq\n\n```\n\n1.Open a browser and go to the **IBM Cloud Pak Platform**. Select **Runtimes** and click **es-demo** for Event Streams.\n\n![](images/lab4-runtimes-es-demo.png)\n\n2.In Welcome to IBM Event Streams page, click Create a topic on the menu bar\n\n![](images/lab4-create-topic.png)\n\n3.In the Create topic. Turn Show all available options to **On**. Use the following values when creating the topics. Create the following topics:\n\n```\n1.\tTopic Name field, enter: **eventtomq**.\n2.\tKeep, Partitions: 1 (A partition is an ordered list of messages).\n3.\tKeep, Replicas: 3 (In order to improve availability, each topic can be replicated onto multiple brokers).\n4.\tKeep, Minimum in-sync replicas: 2 - (In order to improve availability, each topic can be replicated onto multiple brokers).\n5.\tKeep, Retention time: 10 minutes - (It Is time messages are retained before being deleted).\n6.\tClick Create topic.\n\n```\n![](images/lab4-create-topic-eventtomq.png)\n\n4.Repeat step 3, and create a topic **mqtoevent**.\nNote: When all available options are On, you see a great amount of detail for each topic. You only need to edit the Core configuration section. If you turn the switch to Off, you need to click Next three times before the final pane where you click Create topic.\n\n## Task 4 - Setup Kafka Connect\n\nYou can integrate external systems with IBM Event Streams by using the Kafka Connect framework and connectors.\nUse Kafka Connect to reliably move large amounts of data between your Kafka cluster and external systems. For example, it can ingest data from sources such as databases and make the data available for stream processing.\nKafka Connect uses connectors for moving data into and out of Kafka. Source connectors import data from external systems into Kafka topics, and sink connectors export data from Kafka topics into external systems. A wide range of connectors exists, some of which are commercially supported. In addition, you can write your own connectors.\n\n1.In Event Streams **Topics**, verify if the eventtomq and mqtoevent topics are created. Click **Connect to this cluster**. Kafka Connect uses an Apache Kafka client just like a regular application, and the usual authentication and authorization rules apply. Kafka Connect needs authorization to:\n\n```\n1.\tProduce and consume to the internal Kafka Connect topics and, if you want the topics to be created automatically, to create these topics\n2.\tProduce to the target topics of any source connectors you are using\n3.\tConsume from the source topics of any sink connectors you are using\n\n```\n![](images/lab4-connect-to-this-cluster.png)\n\n2.In Cluster connection page, save listener **External (1)**: **es-qs-kafka-bootstrap-eventstreams.apps.demo.ibmdte.net:443** (this address might be different) in a file and then click Generate SCRAM credentials. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_Challenge_Response_Authentication_Mechanism).\n\n![](images/lab4-cluster-connection-external.png)\n\n3.Enter the **credential name** (kafkauser): **mqeventstreams**, check Produce, consume messages and create topics and schemas and click **Next**.\n\n![](images/lab4-generate-credentials-1.png)\n\n4.In **Which topics does the application need to access?**, check **All topics** and click **Next**.\n\n![](images/lab4-which-topics-does-the-application.png)\n\n5.In **Which consumer group does the application need to access?**, check **All consumer groups** and click **Next**.\n\n![](images/lab4-which-topics-does-the-application.png)\n\n6.In **Choose which transactional IDs the application can access**, select **No transactional IDs** and click **Generate credentials**.\n\n![](images/lab4-choose-which-transactional.png)\n\n7.In **Cluster connection**. Event Streams generates the **SCRAM Credentials** as **username** and **password**. Your username is **mqeventstreams**.\n\n![](images/lab4-scram-username.png)\n\n8.Click **Toolbox**. For this lab, you run two connectors (Sink and Source) as distributed mode. When running in distributed mode, Kafka Connect uses three topics to store configuration, current offsets and status. Kafka Connect can create these topics automatically as it is started by the Event Streams operator. By default, the topics are:\n\n```\n1.\tconnect-configs: This topic stores the connector and task configurations.\n2.\tconnect-offsets: This topic stores offsets for Kafka Connect.\n3.\tconnect-status: This topic stores status updates of connectors and tasks.\n(If you want to run multiple Kafka Connect environments on the same cluster, you can override the default names of the topics in the configuration).\n\n```\n![](images/lab-topics-toolbox.png)\n\n9.In **Toolbox** page, locate **Connectors** and click **Set up in Setup a Kafka Connect environment**.\n\n![](images/lab-4-toolkit-connectors.png)\n\n10.To set up the Kafka connect environment. Click **Download Kafka Connect ZIP** to download the compressed file, then extract the contents to your preferred location. The default location is your **~/Downloads** directory. (**Do not close the browser**).\n\n![](images/lab4-setup-kafka-connect.png)\n\n11.Open a terminal window. move **~/Downloads/kafkaconnect.zip** to  **~/Downloads/es-mq** directory (use **mv ~/Downloads/kafkaconnect.zip ~/Downloads/es-mq**).\n\n![](images/lab4-move-kafkaconnect.png)\n\n12.Extract the files in **kafkaconnect.zip**. Execute **unzip kafkaconnect.zip**. You have a Kubernetes manifest for a **KafkaConnectS2I** and an empty directory called **my-plugins**.\n\n![](images/lab4-unzip-kafkaconnect.png)\n\n13.Provide **authentication credentials** in **authentication configuration**. Using the opened terminal window, enter **oc get secrets | grep es-demo**, locate **es-demo-cluster-ca-cert**.\n\n![](images/lab4-es-demo-cluster-ca.png)\n\n14.\tIn the Terminal, go to  **~/Downloads/es-mq** directory and edit **kafka-connect-s2i.yaml**. (We created a copy of **kafka-connect-s2i** as **kafka-connect-s2i.original**). Use **kafka-connect-s2i.original** as **kafka-connect-s2i.yaml**.(Do this **mv kafka-connect-s2i.original kafka-connect-s2i.yaml**).\n**If your using kafka-connect-s2i.original, update the Event Streams bootstrapServers.**\n\n```\n1.\tVerify the name of kafka connector: my-labconnect-cluster\n2.\tEnter Event Streams bootstrapServers (This address is different): es-demo-kafka-bootstrap-cp4i.mycluster-dal12-c-636918-4e85092308b6e4e8c206c47df210f622-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:443.\n3.\tThe productVersion should be changed to 10.1.0.\n4.\tThe productChargedContainers should be my-labconnect-cluster.\n5.\tThe cloudpakVersion should be: 2020.3.1 .\n6.\tWe added this line and enter connection timeout in config: connection.timeout.ms: 50000.\n7.\tWe added this line and enter read timeout in config: read.timeout.ms: 50000.\nRemove all “#”.\n8.\tEnter es-demo-cluster-ca-cert as tls->trustedCertificates->secretname.\n9.\tEnter mqeventstreams as authentication->username.\n10.\tEnter mqeventstreams as authentication->passwordSecret->secretName.\n11.\tEnter password as authentication->passwordSecret->password (it means that you are referencing the password element in the kafkauser).\n\n```\n![](images/lab4-edit-kafka-connector.png)\n\n15.Deploy Kafka connect, in the terminal window in the **~/Downloads/es-mq** directory.\n\n```\n1.\tEnter oc apply -f kafka-connect-s2i.yaml.\n2.\tEnter oc get kafkaconnects2i to verify the Kafka connect instance has been created.\n\n```\n![](images/lab4-oc-apply-kafka.png)\n\n16.You have created a Kafka instance as **OpenShift Operator**, open a browser and go to OpenShift console.\n\n```\n1.\tSelect Operators->Installed Operators.\n2.\tSet Project: eventstreams. Click IBM Event Streams.\n3.  Click Kafka Connect Source to Image.\n\n```\n\n![](images/lab4-check-kafka-connect-operators.png)\n\n## Task 5 - Setup MQ connectors\n\nThe Event Streams connector catalog contains a list of tried and tested connectors from both the community and IBM®. Go to this page and check the IBM supported connectors (https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/connectors/).\n\nBefore you run this Task, check if you have these requirements:\n\n```\n-\tJava Version:\n    java version \"1.8.0_261\"\n    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_261-b12)\n    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.261-b12, mixed mode)\n-\tMaven:\n    https://maven.apache.org/\n\n\n```\n\n1.Back to Set up Kafka Connect environment (you should keep the browser opened).

Leverage your existing investments, skills and even existing data, and use event-driven techniques to offer more-responsive and more-personalized experiences. IBM Event Streams has supported connectivity to the systems you’re already using. By combining the capabilities of IBM Event Streams event streams and message queues, you can combine your transaction data with real-time events to create applications and processes. These applications and processes allow you to react to situations quickly and provide a greater personalized experience.\nIn this tutorial, you create a bidirectional connection between IBM MQ (MQ) and Event Streams by creating two message queues and two event stream topics. One is for sending and one for receiving. You then configure the message queue source and sync connectors in order to connect between the two instances.\nThe connector copies messages from a source MQ queue to a target Event Streams topic. There is also an MQ sink connector that takes messages from an Event Streams topic and transfers them to an MQ queue. Running it is similar to the source connector. In this lab, we will only cover the source and sink connectors. We will then configure the source a sink connector to run some tests to a local stand-alone worker. We then adjust our configuration to send the messages to a topic in Event Streams and run a console consumer to consume the messages.\n\n## Takeaways\n\n```\n\n- Configuring MQ to send and receive messages and events\n- Configuring Event Streams topics\n- Configuring MQ Source and Sync Connectors\n- Configuring Kafka Connect and connectors\n- Setting up and running MQ connectors source and sink\n- Using Event Streams Monitoring\n- Using tracing for MQ\n\n```\n\n## Task 1 - Prepare the environment\n\n**Note: If your using this tutorial in a multi-user ROKS setup, the environment is already prepared for you. Please login to the cluster using LDAP authentication and the credentials provided by your instructor and jump to [Configuring IBM MQ](#task-2-configuring-mq). Also, maske sure that you use a prefix provided by the instructor for queue, topic and server names.**\n\nBecause this is a new deployment of the Cloud Pak for Integration that uses Red Hat OpenShift, you need to run some steps to prepare the environment. Initial setup steps are only needed for a fresh installation of the Cloud Pak. They do not need to be repeated.\n\n**Note: For this lab, we based on MAC workstation (MAC OSX)**\n\nRequirements:\n\n```\n-\tJava Version:\n    java version \"1.8.0_261\"\n    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_261-b12)\n    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.261-b12, mixed mode)\n-\tMaven:\n    https://maven.apache.org/\n-\tGit:\n    https://git-scm.com/\n-\tOpenshift CLI installed\n    https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift-cli#cli_oc\n\n```\n\n1.In your workstation open a browser and enter http://cloud.ibm.com and enter your ibmid  and click continue and password to login IBM Cloud.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-login.png)\n\n2.Enter your IBM userid  and the password and then enter the verify code.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-sign-in.png)\n\n3.In the IBM Cloud Dashboard.

You can use the Clipboard to save the password.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-cp4i-login.png)\n\n9.In the **Cloud Pak Welcome** page, you see **Capabilities** and **Runtimes** instances.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-welcome-capabilities.png)\n\n## Task 2 - Configuring MQ\n\nIn this task, you work with the MQ Console, create two queues (MQTOEVENT and EVENTTOMQ), and change MQ Authorization. The IBM MQ Operator for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides an easy way to manage the lifecycle of IBM MQ queue managers.\nYou need some configuration files from Github.\n\nConnectors are available for copying data in both directions:\n\n```\n•\tKafka Connect **source** connector for IBM MQ:\n  You can use the MQ source connector to copy data from IBM MQ into IBM Event Streams or Apache Kafka. The connector copies messages from a source MQ queue to a target Kafka topic.\n•\tKafka Connect **sink** connector for IBM MQ:\n  You can use the MQ sink connector to copy data from IBM Event Streams or Apache Kafka into IBM MQ. The connector copies messages from a Kafka topic into an MQ queue.\n```\n1.Open a browser and enter: https://github.com/ibm-cloudintegration/dte-labs/tree/master/Lab4-DriveDigitalTransformation/resources  and select es-mq.zip file.\n\n![](images/lab4-github-es-mq.png)\n\n2.Click **Download**.\n\n![](images/lab4-download-git.png)\n\n3.Open a terminal window and enter **unzip es-mq.zip**. Unzip creates a directory **es-mq** in **~/Downloads** directory.\n(**Note**: Use this directory as your work directory and delete after you finish the lab).\n\n![](images/lab4-unzip-es-mq.png)\n\n4.You need to login to the Openshift Cluster. Go to Openshift Console and locate **IAM(your ibm userid)** and click **Copy Login Command**.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-login-command.png)\n\n5.Click **Display Token**.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-display-token.png)\n\n6.Copy the line **oc login  --token= ….** (all line).\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-copy-oc.png)\n\n7.In terminal window, go to **~/Downloads/es-mq** directory and Paste the oc login command.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-oc-login.png)\n\n8.In **es-mq** directory, run loadmq shell script (**./loadmq.sh**) and you see mq configuration being loaded. This shell script loads server channels and changes some securities configurations.\n\n![](images/lab4-loading-mq-conf.png)\n\n9.Prepare IBM MQ to exchange data from IBM Event Streams. You run a script file that configures MQ server (Security and Server Channel). The script creates two server channels: **EVENTTOMQ** and **MQTOEVENT**. In your browser, go to the IBM Cloud Pak Platform. You might need to log in to IBM Cloud Pak. The username and password are already cached (admin/(Enter the 32 characters password that you created when you made the Cloud Pak provisioning)). Click **Log in**.\n\n![](images/ibm-cloud-login-cp4i.png)\n\n10.In the **Welcome page of the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration**, click **Runtimes** and locate the **Queue Manager** in Instance Type and click **mq-demo**.\n\n![](images/lab4-cp4i-welcomepage.png)\n\n11.Firefox might warn you about a potential security risk. Click Advanced then accept the risk and Continue.\n12.In Welcome to IBM MQ page, you can run and access MQ information. Click **Create a queue**.\n\n![](images/lab4-create-queue.png)\n\n13.In Create a queue page, choose queue type: Click **Local**.\n\n![](images/lab4-create-local-queue.png)\n\n14.In the **Create a queue** page. Enter in the Queue name: **MQSOURCE**. Click **Create**.\n\n![](images/lab4-create-mqsource.png)\n\n15.And again, click Create a queue in Welcome to IBM MQ page.\n\n![](images/lab4-create-queue.png)\n\n16.On the Choose queue type, click Local.\n\n![](images/lab4-create-local-queue.png)\n\n17.Enter the queue name: **MQSINK** and click **Create**.\n\n![](images/lab4-create-mqsink.png)\n\n18.Click **Manage** on the menu to check MQ configurations.\n\n![](images/lab4-manage-queue-manager.png)\n\n19.Verify the queues that you created and queue manager name: **QUICKSTART**. Click **Communications** to verify the channels.\n\n![](images/lab4-queue-manager-communication.png)\n\n20.Verify the server channels are created. Click **App channels**. See the server channels that the **loadmq script** created: **EVENTTOMQ** to connect Event Streams to MQ and **MQTOEVENT** to connect MQ to Event Streams.\n\n![](images/lab4-check-server-channels.png)\n\n21.To connect to MQ (**QUICKSTART**), you need MQ server Address. In the Terminal. To get MQ server address, enter the OpenShift commands:\n\n```\n1. oc get svc | grep mq (list the mq services).\n2. Copy the address of mq-demo-ibm-mq (**172.21.216.195**) – This address might be different.\n```\n\n## Task 3 - Configuring Event streams\n\nNow that you are familiar with topics and creating them from the previous labs, you need to create a new topic for running the MQ source connector.\nThe connector requires details to connect to IBM MQ and to your IBM Event Streams or Apache Kafka cluster.\nThe connector connects to IBM MQ using a client connection. You must provide the following connection information for your queue manager:\n\n```\n•\tThe name of the IBM MQ queue manager: QUICKSTART\n•\tThe connection name (one or more host and port pairs): * This is the MQ host address or IP address.\n•\tThe channel name:\n•\tSink: EVENTTOMQ\n•\tSource: MQTOEVENT\n•\tThe name of the source IBM MQ queue: MQSOURCE\n•\tThe name of the sink IBM MQ queue: MQSINK\n•\tThe name of the target Kafka topic: mqtoevent\n•\tThe name of the origin Kafka topic: eventtomq\n\n```\n\n1.Open a browser and go to the **IBM Cloud Pak Platform**. Select **Runtimes** and click **es-demo** for Event Streams.\n\n![](images/lab4-runtimes-es-demo.png)\n\n2.In Welcome to IBM Event Streams page, click Create a topic on the menu bar\n\n![](images/lab4-create-topic.png)\n\n3.In the Create topic. Turn Show all available options to **On**. Use the following values when creating the topics. Create the following topics:\n\n```\n1.\tTopic Name field, enter: **eventtomq**.\n2.\tKeep, Partitions: 1 (A partition is an ordered list of messages).\n3.\tKeep, Replicas: 3 (In order to improve availability, each topic can be replicated onto multiple brokers).\n4.\tKeep, Minimum in-sync replicas: 2 - (In order to improve availability, each topic can be replicated onto multiple brokers).\n5.\tKeep, Retention time: 10 minutes - (It Is time messages are retained before being deleted).\n6.\tClick Create topic.\n\n```\n![](images/lab4-create-topic-eventtomq.png)\n\n4.Repeat step 3, and create a topic **mqtoevent**.\nNote: When all available options are On, you see a great amount of detail for each topic. You only need to edit the Core configuration section. If you turn the switch to Off, you need to click Next three times before the final pane where you click Create topic.\n\n## Task 4 - Setup Kafka Connect\n\nYou can integrate external systems with IBM Event Streams by using the Kafka Connect framework and connectors.\nUse Kafka Connect to reliably move large amounts of data between your Kafka cluster and external systems. For example, it can ingest data from sources such as databases and make the data available for stream processing.\nKafka Connect uses connectors for moving data into and out of Kafka. Source connectors import data from external systems into Kafka topics, and sink connectors export data from Kafka topics into external systems. A wide range of connectors exists, some of which are commercially supported. In addition, you can write your own connectors.\n\n1.In Event Streams **Topics**, verify if the eventtomq and mqtoevent topics are created. Click **Connect to this cluster**. Kafka Connect uses an Apache Kafka client just like a regular application, and the usual authentication and authorization rules apply. Kafka Connect needs authorization to:\n\n```\n1.\tProduce and consume to the internal Kafka Connect topics and, if you want the topics to be created automatically, to create these topics\n2.\tProduce to the target topics of any source connectors you are using\n3.\tConsume from the source topics of any sink connectors you are using\n\n```\n![](images/lab4-connect-to-this-cluster.png)\n\n2.In Cluster connection page, save listener **External (1)**: **es-qs-kafka-bootstrap-eventstreams.apps.demo.ibmdte.net:443** (this address might be different) in a file and then click Generate SCRAM credentials. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_Challenge_Response_Authentication_Mechanism).\n\n![](images/lab4-cluster-connection-external.png)\n\n3.Enter the **credential name** (kafkauser): **mqeventstreams**, check Produce, consume messages and create topics and schemas and click **Next**.\n\n![](images/lab4-generate-credentials-1.png)\n\n4.In **Which topics does the application need to access?**, check **All topics** and click **Next**.\n\n![](images/lab4-which-topics-does-the-application.png)\n\n5.In **Which consumer group does the application need to access?**, check **All consumer groups** and click **Next**.\n\n![](images/lab4-which-topics-does-the-application.png)\n\n6.In **Choose which transactional IDs the application can access**, select **No transactional IDs** and click **Generate credentials**.\n\n![](images/lab4-choose-which-transactional.png)\n\n7.In **Cluster connection**. Event Streams generates the **SCRAM Credentials** as **username** and **password**. Your username is **mqeventstreams**.\n\n![](images/lab4-scram-username.png)\n\n8.Click **Toolbox**. For this lab, you run two connectors (Sink and Source) as distributed mode. When running in distributed mode, Kafka Connect uses three topics to store configuration, current offsets and status. Kafka Connect can create these topics automatically as it is started by the Event Streams operator. By default, the topics are:\n\n```\n1.\tconnect-configs: This topic stores the connector and task configurations.\n2.\tconnect-offsets: This topic stores offsets for Kafka Connect.\n3.\tconnect-status: This topic stores status updates of connectors and tasks.\n(If you want to run multiple Kafka Connect environments on the same cluster, you can override the default names of the topics in the configuration).\n\n```\n![](images/lab-topics-toolbox.png)\n\n9.In **Toolbox** page, locate **Connectors** and click **Set up in Setup a Kafka Connect environment**.\n\n![](images/lab-4-toolkit-connectors.png)\n\n10.To set up the Kafka connect environment. Click **Download Kafka Connect ZIP** to download the compressed file, then extract the contents to your preferred location. The default location is your **~/Downloads** directory. (**Do not close the browser**).\n\n![](images/lab4-setup-kafka-connect.png)\n\n11.Open a terminal window. move **~/Downloads/kafkaconnect.zip** to  **~/Downloads/es-mq** directory (use **mv ~/Downloads/kafkaconnect.zip ~/Downloads/es-mq**).\n\n![](images/lab4-move-kafkaconnect.png)\n\n12.Extract the files in **kafkaconnect.zip**. Execute **unzip kafkaconnect.zip**. You have a Kubernetes manifest for a **KafkaConnectS2I** and an empty directory called **my-plugins**.\n\n![](images/lab4-unzip-kafkaconnect.png)\n\n13.Provide **authentication credentials** in **authentication configuration**. Using the opened terminal window, enter **oc get secrets | grep es-demo**, locate **es-demo-cluster-ca-cert**.\n\n![](images/lab4-es-demo-cluster-ca.png)\n\n14.\tIn the Terminal, go to  **~/Downloads/es-mq** directory and edit **kafka-connect-s2i.yaml**. (We created a copy of **kafka-connect-s2i** as **kafka-connect-s2i.original**). Use **kafka-connect-s2i.original** as **kafka-connect-s2i.yaml**.(Do this **mv kafka-connect-s2i.original kafka-connect-s2i.yaml**).\n**If your using kafka-connect-s2i.original, update the Event Streams bootstrapServers.**\n\n```\n1.\tVerify the name of kafka connector: my-labconnect-cluster\n2.\tEnter Event Streams bootstrapServers (This address is different): es-demo-kafka-bootstrap-cp4i.mycluster-dal12-c-636918-4e85092308b6e4e8c206c47df210f622-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:443.\n3.\tThe productVersion should be changed to 10.1.0.\n4.\tThe productChargedContainers should be my-labconnect-cluster.\n5.\tThe cloudpakVersion should be: 2020.3.1 .\n6.\tWe added this line and enter connection timeout in config: connection.timeout.ms: 50000.\n7.\tWe added this line and enter read timeout in config: read.timeout.ms: 50000.\nRemove all “#”.\n8.\tEnter es-demo-cluster-ca-cert as tls->trustedCertificates->secretname.\n9.\tEnter mqeventstreams as authentication->username.\n10.\tEnter mqeventstreams as authentication->passwordSecret->secretName.\n11.\tEnter password as authentication->passwordSecret->password (it means that you are referencing the password element in the kafkauser).\n\n```\n![](images/lab4-edit-kafka-connector.png)\n\n15.Deploy Kafka connect, in the terminal window in the **~/Downloads/es-mq** directory.\n\n```\n1.\tEnter oc apply -f kafka-connect-s2i.yaml.\n2.\tEnter oc get kafkaconnects2i to verify the Kafka connect instance has been created.\n\n```\n![](images/lab4-oc-apply-kafka.png)\n\n16.You have created a Kafka instance as **OpenShift Operator**, open a browser and go to OpenShift console.\n\n```\n1.\tSelect Operators->Installed Operators.\n2.\tSet Project: eventstreams. Click IBM Event Streams.\n3.  Click Kafka Connect Source to Image.\n\n```\n\n![](images/lab4-check-kafka-connect-operators.png)\n\n## Task 5 - Setup MQ connectors\n\nThe Event Streams connector catalog contains a list of tried and tested connectors from both the community and IBM®. Go to this page and check the IBM supported connectors (https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/connectors/).\n\nBefore you run this Task, check if you have these requirements:\n\n```\n-\tJava Version:\n    java version \"1.8.0_261\"\n    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_261-b12)\n    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.261-b12, mixed mode)\n-\tMaven:\n    https://maven.apache.org/\n\n\n```\n\n1.Back to Set up Kafka Connect environment (you should keep the browser opened). Add two connectors in Kafka Connect Environment, select **Add connectors to your Kafka Connect environment**.\n\n![](images/lab4-add-mq-connectors.png)\n\n2.In Add connectors to your Kafka Connect environment, click IBM MQ Connectors.\n\n![](images/lab4-add-ibm-mq-connectors.png)\n\n3.You can move data between **Event Streams** and **IBM MQ**.
