Copy the mq pods (mq-quickstart-ibm-mq-0).\n\n![](images/lab2-task1.4.png))\n\n5.Execute the shell script to run MQ configuration (update the channel and security). Go to ~/Downloads/mqconf directory and enter ./loadmq.sh mq-quickstart-ibm-mq-0. The MQ configuration will be updated for this lab.\n\n![](images/ace-mq-download-ace-mq.png)\n\n6.Open a browser and select on the Bookmark Bar (IBM Cloud Pak for Integration). From here, you are able to navigate to all the integration and development technology contained within the platform. Today, this technology Capabilities and Runtimes instances. Capabilities include: API Connect, App Connect Dashboard, App Connect Designer , Asset Repository and Operations Dashboard. To access IBM MQ click the Runtimes link. This task covers administering and creating a new queue in IBM MQ. IBM MQ for Cloud Pak for Integration has a web GUI, which the Integration Developer, with security authorization, is able to manage the different IBM MQ objects (queues, channels, topics and so on).\n\n![](images/lab2-task1.6.png))\n\nYou might see this warning (Potential Security Risk Ahead). Click Advance.  And then click the link, Accept the Risk and Continue). Don’t worry there is no Risk for your workstation.\n\n7.You see the IBM MQ Welcome Page and an important tile that can help you learn about MQ technology.
