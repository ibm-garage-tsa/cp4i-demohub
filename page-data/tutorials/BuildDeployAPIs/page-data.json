Modern applications and APIs all need the ability to communicate data reliably between mission critical systems across internal/external data sources, networks, and regions. In mission critical environments your messaging infrastructure must be robust, reliable, and secure with the ability to integrate into your applications and APIs at pace and scale. In this tutorial, you create a message queue that receives order data from an API call to a retail ordering system. The red box in the diagram shows what you are creating and where it fits in the overall architecture of a mobile retail buying application.\n\n### Takeaways\n\n- Exploring multiple integration capabilities within a single platform\n- Configuring IBM MQ\n- Creating an integration flow that connects to a message queue\n- Deploy the integration flow as a container in Kubernetes\n- Checking the message using MQ Web Console\n- Checking this message using Operational Dashboard (tracing)\n\n\n## Task 1 - Preparing the environment\n\n**Note: If your using this in a multi-user ROKS setup, the environment is already prepared for you.
