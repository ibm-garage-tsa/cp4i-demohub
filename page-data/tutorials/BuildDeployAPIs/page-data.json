Spur innovations where a number of technologies are combined to create something new, for example, extending the ability apply for loan pre-approvals that can be used within apps that search for cars or real estate. To do this, you must first create the back-end integrations, which combine data from existing core systems, disparate assets, or SaaS services with the ability to send critical data between systems reliably. Second, you need to provide APIs to your back-end integrations that secure access and apply rate limits.\nIn this tutorial, you learn how to deploy an app integration flow that takes data from one source and sends it to a message queue for reliable delivery. Then, you expose this integration as a rate-limited API secured by a key and secret. This integration flow is deployed quickly and easily as an independent, auto-scalable microservice running on containers. By using RedHat OpenShift as a foundation.\n\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Introduction</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Preparing the environment</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Configuring IBM MQ</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Creating a BAR File</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Deploying a BAR file</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Configuring API Connect</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Sharing the API</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Using Operations Dashboard</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Summary</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Introduction\n\nImplement enterprise grade messaging that is secure and reliable for any application across your backend integration architecture. Modern applications and APIs all need the ability to communicate data reliably between mission critical systems across internal/external data sources, networks, and regions. In mission critical environments your messaging infrastructure must be robust, reliable, and secure with the ability to integrate into your applications and APIs at pace and scale. In this tutorial, you create a message queue that receives order data from an API call to a retail ordering system. The red box in the diagram shows what you are creating and where it fits in the overall architecture of a mobile retail buying application.\n\n### Takeaways\n\n- Exploring multiple integration capabilities within a single platform\n- Configuring IBM MQ\n- Creating an integration flow that connects to a message queue\n- Deploy the integration flow as a container in Kubernetes\n- Checking the message using MQ Web Console\n- Configuring API in API connect\n- Sharing API in Asset Repository\n- Checking this message using Operational Dashboard (tracing)\n\n\n## Preparing the environment\n\n### Task 1 - Preparing the environment\n\n**Note: If your using this tutorial in a multi-user ROKS setup, the environment is already prepared for you.
