Initial setup steps are only needed for a fresh installation of the platform. They do not need to be repeated.\n\n1.All work for this lab is done on the Developer Machine. Open the Developer Machine VM by copying the Client VM VNC link in a browser window from your email or the Reservation Details as shown below.\n\n![](images/tutorial_html_4684368ee9aef605.png)\n\nUse the password specified in parenthesis to login to VNC\n\n![](images/tutorial_html_dcc3a9fa250b6267.png)\n\n2.In your workstation open a browser and enter http://cloud.ibm.com and enter your **ibmid** and click continue and password to login IBM Cloud.\n\n![](images/tutorial_html_40856922adb9fae5.png)\n\n3.Enter your IBM userid  and the password and then enter the verify code.\n\n![](images/tutorial_html_e00b9a6736f7e923.png)\n\n4.In the IBM Cloud Dashboard. You see all information about the infrastructure. On the Resource summary. Observe if you have one cluster and click **Cluster** link.\n\n![](images/tutorial_html_43ece9238189e0a4.png)\n\n5.You see the  available resources for your cluster. Select Clusters arrow and click your cluster line.\n\n![](images/tutorial_html_dd756ffd9ce473bb.png)\n\n6.In the cluster page, you see the status of your cluster infrastructure,. such as worker node, CPU and Memory usage. Click **OpenShift Web Console**.\n\n![](images/tutorial_html_d22a349be88c0a4f.png)\n\n7.In the OpenShift console. Select the following:\n\n```\n    a. **Networking**\n\n    b. **Routes**\n\n    c. Drill down the Project to **Integration**\n\n    d. Click the **Navigator** link.\n\n```\n  ![](images/tutorial_html_ff17543331daf722.png)\n\n8.Select **Default authentication** as authentication type.\n\n![](images/login_cloud_pak_admin_default.png)\n\n9.You might need to login screen for IBM Cloud Pak might be displayed, enter the username: admin and Password (Enter the 32 characters password that you created when you made the Cloud Pak provisioning) and Click Log in.\nTip: You might need to use the password. You can use the Clipboard to save the password.\n\n![](images/login_cloud_pak_userid_password.png)\n\n10.In the Cloud Pak Welcome page, you see Capabilities and Runtimes instances.\n\n![](images/Welcome_IBM_Cloud_Pak.png)\n\n## Creating and managing Event Streams topics\n\nApplications connect to Event Streams topics and write to and read from them. Topics are known groupings of related data. Topics are created and configured by the Event Streams administrator.\n\n1.You use an existing Event Streams instance create In Runtimes and instances.\n\n![](images/select-event_streams.png)\n\n2.You see the Welcome to IBM Event Streams page. You create an Event Streams topic, select and click the Create a topic tile. From this page you can navigate and learn more about Event Streams.\n\n![](images/select_topic.png)\n\n3.Enter the name of topic : **eslabtopic**, this is the name used to identify the topic in the Event Streams instance.\nNote: This lab is preconfigured to connect to that specific topic. You can view the full range of configuration options by setting the **Show all available options** to on. However, this tutorial only focuses on the core set.\n\n![](images/es-eslabtopic.png)\n\n4.Change the partitions to **three** and you see the messages to be distributed across the brokers to increase the scalability. Set three partitions and click **Next**.\n\n![](images/es-3_partitions.png)\n\n5.Define the message retention time. Set it to **10 minutes** for this lab. Click **Next**.\n\n![](images/es-10_minutes.png)\n\n6.Define the number of replicas for your topic.

Your new topic is displayed along with a completion notification. You can now connect the starter application to Event Streams. On the left, click **Toolbox** icon.\n\n![](images/es-toolbox_menu.png)\n\n## Using a Starter application to send and receive data\n\nIn this task shows you how to generate and run a starter application. Using the starter application, you can see how producing and consuming applications connect to a topic and send messages (a message is a unit of data in Kafka). Data sent by the producer can be viewed in the topic in Event Streams. You can then view the same data in the consuming application.\nEvent Streams includes several tools that can be used to test Event Streams and help with the development of Event Steams-based applications.\n\n1.In Toolbox page you can see tools that allow you test and access Event Streams topics. To test the topic that you created, click **Get Started** icon.\n\n![](images/es-toolbox_menu_starter.png)\n\n2.The **Configure & Run starter application** page is displayed where you can configure and generate an application, run an application, and send and receive messages (data).

Type a message (for example: Using IBM Event Streams) in the **payload** field and click **start producing**, and click **start consuming** see messages appearing in the consuming application as they are consumed from the Event Streams topic and let the application running (**54** messages). Look at **Offset**. **Stop the Producer by clicking the start/pause button** (**play button when not active, and spinning blue circle when running**). Also, click the blue icon in the **Consumer** to stop listening for messages. You can see that the message is distributed on three partitions (0, 1, and 2).\n\n![](images/es-running_54_messages.png)\n\n13.Back to **Configure & Run starter** application page. Locate the link **Go to the message browser** to View the messages.\n\n![](images/es-mesage_browse.png)\n\n14.See the messages in the topic: **eslabtopic** and the messages in the three partitions. You can see the Event Streams monitoring tool. On the left menu, click **monitoring icon**.\n\n![](images/es-check_message_and_mnonitor.png)\n\n15.Use the Event Streams interface to evaluate the messages produced, for example, information such as the **Incoming bytes and Outgoing bytes**.\n\n![](images/es-monitoring.png)\n\n## Installing an Event Streams instance using OpenShift Operator\n\nIBM Event Streams v10 is an operator-based release and uses custom resources to define your Event Streams configurations. The Event Streams operator uses the custom resources to deploy and manage the entire lifecycle of your Event Streams instances. You can install in any namespace for this lab use eventstreams namespaces.\n\n1.In the browser, click the Bookmark toolbar OpenShift console. Locate **Operators -> Installed Operators** ,change project to **eventstreams** and click **IBM Event Streams**.\n\n![](images/es-installedOperators-Eventstreams.png)\n\n2.In the Event Streams **Operator Details**.
