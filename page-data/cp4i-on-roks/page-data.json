With powerful deployment, lifecycle management, and\nproduction services running on Red Hat OpenShift, it enables clients to\nleverage the latest agile integration practices, simplify the management\nof their integration architecture, and reduce cost. Getting started with\n**Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I)** on **Red Hat** OpenShift\n**Kubernetes Service (ROKS)** on IBM Cloud has never been easier with\none-click install. The following guide walks you through how to deploy\nCloud Pak Integration on ROKS cluster.\n\nYou will complete the following high level tasks:\n\n-   Create a ROKS cluster in IBM Cloud\n\n-   Install Cloud Pak for Integration on ROKS Cluster\n\n-   Prepare the demo environment\n\n-   Use integrated sales demos or DTE Hands on Labs for your workshops or customer engagements\n\nCreate a ROKS cluster in IBM Cloud \n----------------------------------\n\nCloud Pak for Integration ROKS cluster can be provisioned from IBMDemos\nfor demo purposes, self-learning or Proof of Concept projects. If you\nhave not already provisioned a cluster, follow these steps.\n\n1.  Login to <https://www.ibm.com/demos/> using your IBM credentials\n\n2.  From the featured Collection, select Cloud Pak for Integration\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_d8e6d2c22b10e37d.png)\n\n3.  From the Demo Environments section, select Cloud Pak for Integration\n    ROKS 4.4 Cluster (Express). If you are interetsed in running CP4I 2020.1.1 select ROKS 4.3 cluster.\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_7086b5a8f615cb8b.png)\n\n4.  Clock on **Reserve Instance**. If prompted for login, use your IBM\n    ID credentials.\n\n5.  Enter your **Opportunity number**, **Purpose**, **Provision\n    duration** and **country/region**. The environment can be\n    provisioned immediately by selecting the checkbox for a duration up\n    to 14 days. Make sure you change the duration before you click\n **Create**.\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_9e33530cad3cdfe8.png)\n\n6.  The reservation status is shown in the next screen if there is an\n    available cluster from the pool for immediate use. Otherwise, an\n    email notification will be sent when the cluster is ready.\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_86e8f35571608a88.png)\n\n7.  The reservation details can be viewed by selecting **Details**.\n\n     ![](images/tutorial_html_6d9291b896ee5219.png)\n\nYou are ready to install Cloud Pak for Integration!\n\nInstall Cloud Pak for Integration on ROKS cluster \n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1.  Login to <https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog> if have not already\n\n2.  From the Catalog, select **Cloud Pak for Integration**\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_4cb9b9db063e29fd.png)\n\n3.  Select the Redhat Openshift Cluster that you just created from the\n    list. The DTE provisioned cluster name starts with playgrowth. Enter\n    a project name, and a tag name to identify your cluster.\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_ff093f28f345b4d6.png)\n\n4.  Skip this step if you are using Cloud Pak for Integration 2020.2.1 or higher. If you are using the schematics for CP4I 2020.1.1 \n    you must run the preinstallation script before you install the Cloud\n    Pak. There is no need to modify the content of the script, simply\n    click on Run Script to complete the pre-installation step.\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_56c1550f7625ea2f.png)\n\n    Once the pre-installation step is complete, you may proceed with the\n    installation.\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_9367ceb312dd07a1.png)\n\n5.  Enter a value for csDefaultAdminPassword. It is important that you\n    choose a password that is 32 characters in length and it conforms to\n    the password rule - number, letter, -.\n\n     Note: Currently password validation is not enforced on this page. If you proceed with an invalid password you will be able to start the installation but it will fail. There is no way to recover from this error other than provisioning a new cluster.\n\n6.  Scroll down to 'Parameters with default values' and click on the\n    'twisty' to open them. There is no need to change the default values\n    except for the parameters that start with demo.\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_873d5b430786fcde.png)\n\n    If you do have an SMTP email server and accounts that you can use, you\n    may sign up for a free mailtrap.io account using\n    [https://mailtrap.io](https://mailtrap.io/). Mailtrap.io is a free cloud\n    service that mimics an SMTP server. It is used for\n    development/demonstration purposes only.\n\n    Fill in the following fields:\n\n    demoPreparation: Set to 'true'\n\n    demoAPICEmailAddress: if you're using mailtrap.io, use any email\n    address. Use 'apicadmin@example.com' to be safe -- example.com is\n    guaranteed to not be a real domain. If you're using your own mail\n    server, use an email address that you can receive and read.\n\n    demoAPICMailServerPort: if you're using mailtrap, leave this as 2525\n\n    demoAPICMialServerUsername: Set this to your mailtrap user name\n\n    demoAPICMailServerPassword: Set this to your mailtrap password.\n\n7.  Accept the license agreement and click **Install** to install Cloud\n    Pak for Integration. The installation will take up to 60 minutes.\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_4e481413f0c6156e.png)\n\n8.  You can view the progress in the Schematics progress bar or check\n    the details in view log.\n\n    ![](images/tutorial_html_a0d985d2de87ca96.png)\n\n9.
