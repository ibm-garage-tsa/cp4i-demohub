For example when requesting quotes to fly from New York to Los Angeles, a direct flight may be more expensive than a stop over: Whether it is worth the extra money to fly direct is up to the user.\n\nOur scenario concerns someone who has incurred minor damage to their car –it’s not serious, more of a small dent. They wantit repaired at home, on their driveway by a mobile repairer.\n\n\n![](images/scenario-1.png)\n\nThey use an app to get some quotes from three repair companies.They provide their name, eMail, License Plate, State and the number of dents in each part of their car.\n\nEach company providesa quote for the repair and the earliest date that they could perform the repair. These quotes are returned to the user but also stored in a database so that the user can retrieve them for future reference.\n\nIn a real-world application, we could have the user accepting the quote, changing their appointment time etc, all through the API. We supply the source for all of the artefacts so you can extend the scenario if you wish.\n\n***\n\n### Demo Video\nDo you want to understand better the Dent Deletion Demo?
