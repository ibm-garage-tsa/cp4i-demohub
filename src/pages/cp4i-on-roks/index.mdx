IBM Cloud Pak for Integration brings together IBM's market-leading
middleware capabilities to support a broad range of integration styles
and use cases. With powerful deployment, lifecycle management, and
production services running on Red Hat OpenShift, it enables clients to
leverage the latest agile integration practices, simplify the management
of their integration architecture, and reduce cost. Getting started with
**Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I)** on **Red Hat** OpenShift
**Kubernetes Service (ROKS)** on IBM Cloud has never been easier with
one-click install. The following guide walks you through how to deploy
Cloud Pak Integration on ROKS cluster.

6.  Scroll down. On *Set the deployment values* section. Unmark the **Use an existing secret?** to define a new password and enter a value for csDefaultAdminPassword. It is important that you choose a password that is 32 characters in length and it conforms to the password rule - number, letter, -.

     *Note: Currently password validation is not enforced on this page. If you proceed with an invalid password you will be able to start the installation but it will fail. There is no way to recover from this error other than provisioning a new cluster.*

7.  Scroll down to 'Parameters with default values' and click on the 'twisty' to open them. There is no need to change the default values except for the parameters that start with demo.

    If you do have an SMTP email server and accounts that you can use, you may sign up for a free mailtrap.io account using [https://mailtrap.io](https://mailtrap.io/). Mailtrap.io is a free cloud service that mimics an SMTP server. It is used for development/demonstration purposes only.

    Fill in the following fields:

    demoPreparation: Set to 'true'

    demoAPICEmailAddress: if you're using mailtrap.io, use any email address. Use 'apicadmin@example.com' to be safe -- example.com is guaranteed to not be a real domain. If you're using your own mail server, use an email address that you can receive and read.

    demoAPICMailServerPort: if you're using mailtrap, leave this as 2525

    demoAPICMialServerUsername: Set this to your mailtrap username.

    demoAPICMailServerPassword: Set this to your mailtrap password.

    You are welcome to set true in drivewayDentDeletionDemo and eventEnabledInsuranceDemo, if you desire.

7.  Accept the license agreement and click **Install** to install Cloud
    Pak for Integration. The installation will take up to 90 minutes.
