description: IBM Cloud Pak for Integration

IBM Cloud Pak for Integration brings together IBM's market-leading
middleware capabilities to support a broad range of integration styles
and use cases. With powerful deployment, lifecycle management, and
production services running on Red Hat OpenShift, it enables clients to
leverage the latest agile integration practices, simplify the management
of their integration architecture, and reduce cost. In this document you
request access to a shared Cloud Pak for Integrations on ROKS, to be used in
Sales Demos. The environment is pre-installed with demo assets, and you just
need to follow the Demo Script. Remember, this is a shared environment, please
don't customize or change anything there. If you need your own environment,
follow the directions from [Request your own CP4I environment on ROKS](/cp4i-demohub/cp4i-on-roks/).
