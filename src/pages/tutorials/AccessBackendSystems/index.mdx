## Introduction

Implement enterprise grade messaging that is secure and reliable for any application across your backend integration architecture. Modern applications and APIs all need the ability to communicate data reliably between mission critical systems across internal/external data sources, networks, and regions. In mission critical environments your messaging infrastructure must be robust, reliable, and secure with the ability to integrate into your applications and APIs at pace and scale. In this tutorial, you create a message queue that receives order data from an API call to a retail ordering system. The red box in the diagram shows what you are creating and where it fits in the overall architecture of a mobile retail buying application.

## Takeaways

- Exploring multiple integration capabilities within a single platform
- Configuring IBM MQ
- Creating an integration flow that connects to a message queue
- Deploy the integration flow as a container in Kubernetes
- Checking the message using MQ Web Console
- Checking this message using Operational Dashboard (tracing)

![](images/ace-mq-ace-mqfile.png)

4.Click **Download** and save to your download directory (**/home/student/Downloads** ).

![](images/ace-mq-download-ace-mq.png)

5.Download **mqconf.zip** and save in **/home/student/Downloads**.

6.You need to configure IBM MQ permissions in MQ Runtime, before creating a local queue. Open a terminal window.

![](images/es-command_line.png)

7.In **/home/student** directory, create a work directory **mq-lab**. Use **mkdir -p mq-lab** .

![](images/ace-mq-mkdir.png)

8.Move the two files(**ace-mq.zip** and **mqconf.zip**) from **/home/student/Downloads** to **/home/student/mq-lab**. Use mv **/home/student/Downloads/ace-mq.zip /home/student/mq-lab** and **mv /home/student/Downloads/ace-mqconfig.zip /home/student/mq-lab**.

![](images/ace-mq-move-two-file.png)

9.Go to **/home/student/mq-lab** directory and uncompressing the **mqconfig.zip** . (**Do not uncompress ace-mq.zip**)

10.The uncompressing process creates a directory **mqconf**. This directory contains IBM MQ Queue Manager security configuration. Go to **/home/student/mq-lab/mqconfig** and enter **./loadmq.sh** shell script.

![](images/ace-mq-unzip-mqconfig.png)

11.You have the MQ server configured to be accessed by App Connect Enterprise.

  3.	Switch to **ON** to use **Operational Dashboard (tracing)**.
  4.	Enter Operational Dashboard instance namespace: **cp4i**.
  5.	Update the App Connect Enterprise version to the latest: **11.0.0.9 r3** .
  6.	Click **Create** .

```
![](images/ace-mq-configure-integration-server.png)

9.You see the **App Connect Enterprise Dashboard** with the Integration Server **neworder** deployed and started. Click the **neworder** server icon.

**Note:** The deployment process takes up to 5 minutes, refresh the browser to see the BAR file deployed and started.

![](images/ace-mq-neworder-server.png)

10.Click the **neworder API** icon.

![](images/ace-mq-neworder-api.png)

11.This page displays and copy the REST API Base URL (**Endpoint**), use the base URL (in the example :  http://neworder-http-cp4i.mycluster-dal12-c3c-32x-4e85092308b6e4e8c206c47df210f622-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:80/neworder/v1/). It might be different.
In this page, you can download a swagger file (you can import this file in API Connect and access by way of API Connect).

![](images/ace-mq-neworder-endpoint.png)

12.Open a terminal window and enter the curl command: curl -k  --request GET http://neworder-http-cp4i.mycluster-dal12-c3c-32x-4e85092308b6e4e8c206c47df210f622-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud:80/neworder/v1/00000. And see the results

![](images/ace-mq-curl-result.png)

13.You check the message arrived in queue **NEWORDER** in IBM MQ (**QUICKSTART**). You can check using IBM MQ Console. Open a browser and click **Cloud Pak Platform Navigator** and go to **Runtimes** and click **mq-demo** in the instance **Queue Manager**.
